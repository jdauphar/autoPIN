# autoPIN
Ever have to use a system involving a Personal Identification Number, and don't feel up to the task of coming up with one??? Even though PINs are deprecated, people still use them. With autoPIN, the user can enter in a PIN length, up to max_int, and the extremely portable autoPIN system will come up with a 'random' pin!
