# autoPIN
Ever have to use a Personal Identification Number, and don't feel up to the task of coming up with a PIN?? Even though PINs are deprecated, people still use them. With autoPIN, the user can enter in a PIN length, up to the size of an unsized integer, and the extremely portable autoPIN system will come up with a 'random' pin!
